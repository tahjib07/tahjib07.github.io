### [NeuroBehavioral Insights: Analysis of Neurobehavioral Data](https://github.com/tahjib07/NeuroBehavioral-Insights)
- **Overview**: In this project, I developed a **data analysis framework** to explore neurobehavioral patterns using tests like the **Hole Board Test**, **Forced Swim Test**, and **Elevated Plus Maze**. The project aimed to analyze behavior traits such as **exploratory behavior**, **anxiety-like traits**, and **depressive-like behavior** in experimental subjects.
- **Key Insights**:
  - **Behavioral Patterns**: Analyzed the results from various neurobehavioral tests to identify key trends in subjects' responses.
  - **Statistical Analysis**: Employed statistical methods in **Python** to derive meaningful insights from behavioral data.
  - **Visualization**: Visualized the results with **matplotlib**, showcasing trends and behavior changes across tests, which could aid future research in neuropsychology.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Statistical Analysis, Matplotlib

### [Sales Dashboard | Data Analytics & Business Intelligence](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tahjib07_dataanalytics-salesdashboard-businessintelligence-activity-7255249037111537664-kT1R?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAADGRFAkB598hY192a-Dn42XQJH-JRqGtv80)

- **Overview**: Designed and developed a **Sales Dashboard** using **Power BI** to track and visualize the sales performance of different product categories within the healthcare sector. The dashboard integrates data from multiple sources, providing a unified view of key metrics like revenue, sales trends, and customer demographics.
- **Key Insights**:  
  - **Sales Trend Analysis**: Uncovered seasonal sales trends and fluctuations, helping the team optimize inventory and sales strategies based on predictive insights.
  - **Revenue Distribution**: Pinpointed the highest-revenue product categories, enabling the business to focus marketing and sales efforts on these areas.
  - **Performance by Region**: Enabled stakeholders to quickly identify regional sales disparities, which informed better resource allocation.
  - **Actionable Insights**: Provided actionable insights that empowered the sales team to make data-driven decisions and improve overall sales performance by adjusting strategies in real-time.
- **Tools Used**: Power BI, Data Analytics, Business Intelligence, Python (for data wrangling and transformation)

### [Finding the Best Location for Hybrid Renewable Energy Model Using Weighted Scoring Model](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tahjib07_datascience-renewableenergy-sustainability-activity-7256336730784444416-Buy9?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAADGRFAkB598hY192a-Dn42XQJH-JRqGtv80)
- **Overview**: In this project, I analyzed different locations to determine the best spots for setting up a **hybrid renewable energy model** that combines **solar** and **wind power**. By leveraging key data on **radiation**, **wind speeds**, and **land suitability**, I calculated a **weighted score** to rank the locations based on their renewable energy potential.
- **Key Insights**:
  - **Prioritizing Data**: Sunlight was given the highest weight, followed by wind speed and land clearance, ensuring the best renewable energy sites were prioritized.
  - **Calculating Scores**: Weighted scores were used for each location to ensure that areas with high potential for both solar and wind energy were ranked higher.
  - **Visualization**: A **bar chart** was created to clearly highlight the locations with the best renewable energy potential, making the analysis both informative and actionable.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Data Science, Pandas, Matplotlib, Renewable Energy Analysis
