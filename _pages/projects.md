## NeuroBehavioral Insights: Analysis of Neurobehavioral Data

**Overview**: In this project, I developed a **data analysis framework** to explore neurobehavioral patterns using tests like the **Hole Board Test**, **Forced Swim Test**, and **Elevated Plus Maze**. The goal was to uncover traits such as **exploratory behavior**, **anxiety-like traits**, and **depressive-like behavior** in subjects.

**Key Insights**:
- **Behavioral Patterns**: Identified trends in responses across different tests.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Employed Python-based methods to derive insights.
- **Visualization**: Used `matplotlib` to present findings for research usability.

**Tools Used**: Python, Pandas, Statistical Analysis, Matplotlib
