### [Finding the Best Location for Hybrid Renewable Energy Model Using Weighted Scoring Model](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/tahjib07_datascience-renewableenergy-sustainability-activity-7256336730784444416-Buy9?utm_source=social_share_send&utm_medium=member_desktop_web&rcm=ACoAADGRFAkB598hY192a-Dn42XQJH-JRqGtv80)
- **Overview**: In this project, I analyzed different locations to determine the best spots for setting up a **hybrid renewable energy model** that combines **solar** and **wind power**. By leveraging key data on **radiation**, **wind speeds**, and **land suitability**, I calculated a **weighted score** to rank the locations based on their renewable energy potential.
- **Key Insights**:
  - **Prioritizing Data**: Sunlight was given the highest weight, followed by wind speed and land clearance, ensuring the best renewable energy sites were prioritized.
  - **Calculating Scores**: Weighted scores were used for each location to ensure that areas with high potential for both solar and wind energy were ranked higher.
  - **Visualization**: A **bar chart** was created to clearly highlight the locations with the best renewable energy potential, making the analysis both informative and actionable.
- **Tools Used**: Python, Data Science, Pandas, Matplotlib, Renewable Energy Analysis
