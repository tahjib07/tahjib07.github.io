## Projects

####  [**NeuroBehavioral Insights: Analysis of Neurobehavioral Data.**](https://github.com/tahjib07/NeuroBehavioral-Insights)
Developed a data analysis framework for understanding neurobehavioral patterns using various behavioral tests like the **Hole Board Test**, **Forced Swim Test**, and **Elevated Plus Maze**. This project used **Python** for statistical analysis and **matplotlib** for visualizing data, including error bars (SEM). The visualizations provide insights into exploratory behavior, anxiety-like traits, and depressive-like behavior in experimental subjects. The results can contribute to future research in neuropsychology and behavioral neuroscience, helping identify underlying patterns in test data. The project included a GitHub repository with all scripts, data, and visualizations shared for public use.

- **Key Contributions**:
  - Created visualizations to assess behavioral data from experiments, focusing on open-arm exploration, immobility time, and exploratory behavior.
  - Applied statistical methods to compute SEM and visualize error bars for precise data interpretation.
  - The full project is available on the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/tahjib07/NeuroBehavioral-Insights).
